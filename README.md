## Basic outline

I think so far it makes alot of sense to do a corrective agentic rag setup so the underlying information in response to tech prompts is as accurate as possible (minimizes hallucination, grounds in relevant information). (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09136)

## Steps (in order of priority)
1. Integrate Deepseek
2. Populate retriever data
3. Create agent nodes
4. Edit react chat ui
5. Integrate Corrective critic layer
6. Export environment, DOCs
7. Container orchestration in docker to avoid compatibility issues
